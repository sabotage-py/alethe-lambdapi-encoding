Encode Alethe proof rules in Lambdapi
=====================================

This is a [Lambdapi](https://lambdapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package that is needed to check and run the output of [this translator](https://github/com/sabotage-py/alethe-lambdapi) for Alethe proofs to Lambdapi.

[Alethe](https://verit.loria.fr/documentation/alethe-spec.pdf) is a proof format to represent unsatisfiability proofs generated by SMT solvers (in particular veriT).

[Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) is a proof assistant
based on the λΠ-calculus modulo rewriting. You may refer to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00543.pdf).

This package encodes some preliminary logic and simple proof rules (as given in [this](https://verit.loria.fr/documentation/alethe-spec.pdf)) in Lambdapi. The [Alethe-to-Lambdapi translator](https://github/com/sabotage-py/alethe-lambdapi) builds upon this to encode more complex rules in Lambdapi.

For example, the file `qfuf.lp` encodes the QF_UF logic (as defined [here](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/logics.shtml)) and some simple Alethe rules that deal with Boolean logic.

Compilation from the source
---------------------------

You can get the source using `git` as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabotage-py/alethe-lambdapi-encoding
```

Then run the command `make install` in the source directory.

You can then use it in other Lambdapi files using `require open alethe-lambdapi-encoding.qfuf`.
